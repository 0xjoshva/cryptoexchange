    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Tide was launched in September 2022 by founder and current CEO, Joshua
      Steed, who set up the cryptocurrency exchange with the mission to put the
      future of money in the pockets of the world. <br />
      Since then, it has grown into a trusted platform where merchants and
      consumers can transact with digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum,
      Solana, Ripple, and many more. <br />
      We're based in the United Kingdom. Our team currently consists of over 20
      ambitious and talented members from all over the globe, who are not only
      great at what they do but are equally passionate about turning our mission
      into reality. <br />
      At its inception, we only catered to African countries but have since
      expanded to most other countries in the world. <br />
      Tide now has hundreds of thousands of users as we seek to build global
      cooperation with counterpart organizations across other countries and with
      international bodies.
      <br />
      <br />
      At its core, Tide is all about ease of use. To stay ahead of the curve, we
      continuously work on strengthening Tides’s position as Africa’s leading
      platform for digital assets while expanding our scope to introduce new
      services. <br />
      For too long, our shallow pockets have been a reminder of the illusion of
      control centralized institutions have sewed upon us. Day by day, we tear a
      stitch, seeing the glimmer, a faint sliver of what our money, our very
      lives, could look like truly unencumbered by an aged system.
      <br />
      <br />
      With cryptocurrency, we have broken every stitch and found the true depth
      our pockets have yearned to provide for our financial future. <br />
      Fighting by your side, Tide will help guide you along this path, by
      putting the future of money, in your pockets.
